Assignment: Lab1

For this lab we were presented with a program in C++ that needed to be converted to C. In the main program I initalize an integer with a value of 1. A function is called to double the integer that is sent to the function. The function is then called again to be doubled. 

For the second part of the lab an array of characters is to be printed to the screen. Using a function call, the character array is appended with another character and printed on the screen. The new character string is then appended two more times with character. The string is printed onto the screen each time that a character is appened.
