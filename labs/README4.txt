// Lab 4
// Name: Hugo Trejo

For this lab we were asked to create a similar version of lab 3 except that instead of using an array we had to convert it to a linked list. I managed to move the current node to the next node after I called the step function. I didn't include the Print list because it did not ask to do so. The challenging part was keeping track of the previous node from the current node. Unfortunately I wasn't able to work out the error for the segmentation dump. It was a real headache.
