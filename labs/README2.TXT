Assignment: Lab2

For this lab we were asked to create a calculator in hex. A file with inputs were given. Using the scanf function we had to read in a line with a command and a digit. A specific command will accomplish a task. set, shl, shr, and, or, and xor will perform accordingly. I was able to create functions, but found that using no function concluded in less code.
