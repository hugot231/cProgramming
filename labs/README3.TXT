Assignment: Lab3

For this lab we were asked to create a calculator in hex using the structure. A file with inputs from lab 2 were to be used again. A structure with the line number, command and argument were used. The information was not to be read in but hard copied. A specific command will accomplish a task. set, shl, shr, and, or, and xor will perform accordingly. I was not able to comlete the program, but will keep working on it and ask accordingly.
